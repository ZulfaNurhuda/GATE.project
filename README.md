# **🚀・GATE - Ganesha Algorithmic Transpiler Engine**

### **Ever Dreamed of Making Your NOTAL Algorithms Run? ✨**

Welcome to GATE! This awesome project is your magical bridge, transforming your brilliant algorithms written in the Bandung Institute of Technology's Algorithmic Notation (NOTAL) into super-functional, executable Pascal code! Think of it as giving your NOTAL ideas a voice that computers can understand and run. No more just writing algorithms – let's make them *do* things!

### <div id="what-is-gate">**✨・What is GATE?**</div>

GATE (Ganesha Algorithmic Transpiler Engine) is a super cool "translation compiler" designed to take your algorithms, written in the unique Algorithmic Notation of Bandung Institute of Technology (NOTAL), and turn them into ready-to-run Pascal programming language scripts! 🚀 Our main goal is to create a seamless, fun bridge between your awesome algorithmic designs and their practical, executable life in Pascal. Get ready to see your algorithms in action!

### <div id="getting-started">**🛠️・Getting Started (Let's Get This Party Started! 🎉)**</div>

Ready to bring your NOTAL creations to life? Here's how to get GATE up and running in a flash:

1.  **Clone the magic!** ✨
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GATE.project.git
    cd GATE.project
    ```
2.  **Build the engine!** 🏗️
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    (This command compiles everything and gets GATE ready to work its transpilation wonders!)

### <div id="how-to-use">**🗺️・How to Use (Your NOTAL to Pascal Journey! 🚀)**</div>

Once GATE is built, you're just one command away from seeing your NOTAL algorithms transformed into Pascal code that you can compile and run! It's like magic, but with code:

```bash
./bin/transpiler <your_notal_file.notal> -o <your_pascal_output.pas>
```

Simply replace `<your_notal_file.notal>` with the path to your NOTAL source file, and `<your_pascal_output.pas>` with the name you want for your shiny new Pascal file. This Pascal file will contain the fully translated, executable version of your algorithm, ready to be compiled and run by any Pascal compiler!
