### <div id="what-is-gate">**✨・What is GATE?**</div>

GATE (Ganesha Algorithmic Transpiler Engine) is a super cool "translation compiler" designed to take your algorithms, written in the unique Algorithmic Notation of Bandung Institute of Technology (NOTAL), and turn them into ready-to-run Pascal programming language scripts! 🚀 Our main goal is to create a seamless, fun bridge between your awesome algorithmic designs and their practical, executable life in Pascal. Get ready to see your algorithms in action!

### <div id="getting-started">**🛠️・Getting Started (Let's Get This Party Started! 🎉)**</div>

Ready to bring your NOTAL creations to life? Here's how to get GATE up and running in a flash:

1.  **Clone the magic!** ✨
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GATE.project.git
    cd GATE.project
    ```
2.  **Install GCC Toolchain (Get Ready to Compile! ⚙️)**

    To build GATE, you'll need a C++ compiler and `make`. We recommend the GCC toolchain. Here's how to get it on your system:

    ##### **Windows (using MSYS2)**

    MSYS2 provides a Unix-like environment and a package manager (pacman) to easily install GCC and other development tools on Windows.

    1.  **Download MSYS2:** Visit [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/) and download the installer.
    2.  **Run the Installer:** Follow the installation wizard. It's recommended to install it to a short path like `C:\msys64`.
    3.  **Update MSYS2 Packages:** Open the MSYS2 MSYS terminal (from your Start Menu) and run:
        ```bash
        pacman -Syu
        ```
        If prompted to close the terminal, do so and reopen it, then run `pacman -Syu` again until no more updates are available.
    4.  **Install GCC and Make:** In the MSYS2 MSYS terminal, install the `mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain` (for 64-bit) which includes `g++` and `make`:
        ```bash
        pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
        ```
        When prompted to select packages, usually pressing Enter to select all defaults is fine.
    5.  **Add to PATH (Optional but Recommended):** To use `g++` and `make` from any command prompt (CMD/PowerShell), add the `mingw64/bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable (e.g., `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`).

    ##### **Linux**

    For most Linux distributions, you can install the build-essential package, which includes `g++` and `make`:

    *   **Debian/Ubuntu-based:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install build-essential
        ```
    *   **Fedora/RHEL-based:**
        ```bash
        sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
        ```
    *   **Arch Linux:**
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -S base-devel
        ```

    ##### **macOS**

    On macOS, you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which include `clang` (Apple's default C/C++ compiler, compatible with GCC standards) and `make`:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

    ##### **Verify Installation (for all OS)**

    After installation, open a new terminal (or reopen an existing one) and type:

    ```bash
    g++ --version
    make --version
    ```
    If you see version information for both, you're ready to build GATE! 🎉

3.  **Build the engine!** 🏗️
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    (This command compiles everything and gets GATE ready to work its transpilation wonders!)

### <div id="how-to-use">**🗺️・How to Use (Your NOTAL to Pascal Journey! 🚀)**</div>

Once GATE is built, you're just one command away from seeing your NOTAL algorithms transformed into Pascal code that you can compile and run! It's like magic, but with code:

```bash
./bin/transpiler <your_notal_file.notal> -o <your_pascal_output.pas>
```

Simply replace `<your_notal_file.notal>` with the path to your NOTAL source file, and `<your_pascal_output.pas>` with the name you want for your shiny new Pascal file. This Pascal file will contain the fully translated, executable version of your algorithm, ready to be compiled and run by any Pascal compiler!

### <div id="install-fpc">**💻・Installing Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) (Get Ready to Run! 🏃‍♀️)**</div>

To truly bring your transpiled Pascal code to life, you'll need a Pascal compiler! We recommend using **Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)**, a fantastic, open-source compiler that's super easy to get started with. Here's how to install it on your favorite operating system:

#### **Windows**

1.  **Download the Installer:** Head over to the official Free Pascal website's download page: [https://www.freepascal.org/download.html](https://www.freepascal.org/download.html)
2.  **Find the Windows Installer:** Look for the "Windows" section and download the appropriate installer (usually a `.exe` file). Choose the version that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
3.  **Run the Installer:** Once downloaded, double-click the `.exe` file to start the installation wizard. Follow the on-screen prompts.
    *   **Important Tip:** During installation, make sure to select the option to "Add Free Pascal to the system PATH" or similar. This will allow you to run `fpc` commands directly from your command prompt! If you miss this, you might need to add it manually later.

#### **Linux**

For most Linux distributions, you can install FPC using your package manager. Here are some common commands:

*   **Debian/Ubuntu-based:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fpc
    ```
*   **Fedora/RHEL-based:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install fpc
    ```
*   **Arch Linux:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S fpc
    ```

#### **macOS**

On macOS, the easiest way to install FPC is using Homebrew:

1.  **Install Homebrew (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2.  **Install FPC:**
    ```bash
    brew install fpc
    ```

#### **Verify Installation (for all OS)**

After installation, open a new terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Linux/macOS) and type:

```bash
fpc -i
```

If you see information about the FPC version, congratulations! You're all set to compile your Pascal masterpieces! 🎉
